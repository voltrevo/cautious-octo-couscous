# mpc-hello with NextJS (client <> client)

This is a template repository designed to be the hello-world of
[mpc-framework](https://github.com/voltrevo/mpc-framework).

It uses [summon](https://github.com/voltrevo/summon) for circuit generation
and [emp-wasm-backend](https://github.com/voltrevo/emp-wasm-backend) for
secure 2PC.

It's a minimal web app where users can make 1-to-1 connections with each other
and compute the larger of two numbers, built with Next.js.

- 250 sloc
- Simple frontend
- P2P end-to-end encrypted communication
- Circuit code included via ordinary project files

Below are other examples of mpc-hello applications you may want to explore:

- [**Client-Client**](../client-client)
- [**Client-Server**](../client-server)
- [**Server-Server**](../server-server)

## Running Locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Updating the Percentage Display

The percentage display works using a constant `TOTAL_BYTES` and comparing this
to the number of bytes sent and received:

```ts
const TOTAL_BYTES = 248476;
```

When you change the circuit, this number needs to be changed to calculate the
correct percentages. To find the new value, just run your app with dev tools
open. An error message will be displayed containing the new value.
